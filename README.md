# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 44
**The Digital Divide**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 44 brings [a viz](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w44/workspace/file?filename=The+digital+gender+divide.png) showing gender gap ratios for internet access by country as a bar chart, and the same ratios as a map for mobile phone access.

## Data Source
Data comes from several sources, including the Economist Intelligence Unit [here](https://theinclusiveinternet.eiu.com/explore/countries/performance?category=overall)

## My Approach for Week 44
The original viz was very busy and nothing jumped out. My approach was to simplify the design and invite the reader to explore the viz more, embedding documentation in tooltips and inviting clarity through layout.
